# Grocery Tycoon Easter Eggs

## Walmart Mode
If store name is or starts with "Walmart", there is a higher chance of Karens
and weird customers coming to the store. This was inspired by r/peopleofwalmart
on Reddit.

## Windows is unstable
If playing on Windows, there is a little higher chance that the point of sale
machines will break down.

## GNU/Linux
If playing on Linux, every 50th customer will be named Linus T. or Richard S.
after Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman.

If a Richard S. spawns while a Linus T. is in the store, or vise-versa,
Richard S. will think "I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're
referring to as Linux, is in fact GNU/Linux, or as I've taken to calling it,
GNU plus Linux." and Linus T. will think "No Richard, it's Linux, not
GNU/Linux."

## BSD Beastie
If playing on a BSD based operating system, there is a 1 in 500 chance a
customer named Beastie B. with all red colors will spawn.

## Meta Runner characters
The creator of Grocery Tycoon likes Meta Runner. If a customer spawns with one
of the following names, they will be colored accordingly. For the characters
whose last name is unknown, A is used.

- Belle F.
- Derek L.
- Evelyn C.
- Lamar W.
- Lucinia P.
- Marco A.
- Masa S.
- Sofia P.
- Tari A.
- Theo A.

Every one of Sofia P's colors are extracted from several frames of Sofia Porter
in Meta Runner.

## VADIM BLYAT
If a customer spawns with the name Vadim B. every customer will think
"VADIM BLYAT".

## Falling into the void
If a customer is picked up by the player and dropped on a tile outside the store
floor, they will fall into the void below. After falling at least 64 units, the
customer will start losing 4 out of 20 health every 0.5 seconds until they die,
just like in Minecraft. The store rating drops when a customer dies.

## Block 3074
If the store name contains "Block 3074", audio from customers will not play,
and a random customer will think "You can't even hear me. I'm just talking into
the void."

This is inspired by the Xbox using network port 3074 for voice chat.
